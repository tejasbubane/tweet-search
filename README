This is a real quick code that I wrote to just get acquainted with the twitter search API.
Documentation for the same can be found at: https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/search

I came to know of the API when I was doing the Udacity-CS253 course on Building Web Applications
and just played on it a bit and happened to write this code.

Usage:
1. run the twitter.py
2. Enter the twitter username whose tweets you want to see
3. See the tweets below!!
